            <h1>Star System</h1>
            <p>The planet of Erdain is located in a Type-S Binary Star System, in which two stars, Narháera and
                Ghaláera,
                orbit around a center of mass at a distance of around 80 to 100 Astronomical Units (in earthly
                measurements).
            <p>These stars weren't arranged together since they were born though. Our planet orbits around Narháera,
                which
                may be only half as massive as its partner, but is more than three times as old. As it drifted through the galaxy,
                its
                orbit met young Ghaláera's by around 1.28 billion Erdain-Years (or 800 million Earth-Years) before the
                development of Hominid Societies, creating a binary system which seems to be gradually pulling the stars
                closer together.</p>

                <p>Because the two stars orbit around a baricenter but their masses are so different, the distance between them varies considerably as their cycles go in and out of sync. around 5000 earth-years to orbit? wip</p>

                Narháera is the star around the planet of Erdain orbits. Its color frequencies peak at a light green.
                Our planet receives similar amounts of heat from its star as the Earth receives from the Sun, despite
                Narháera having a lower mass and temperature. This is because our planet orbits considerably closer to
                its star. The implication of this though is that the planet of Erdain is subject to more radiation,
                which is at least slightly, but not fully, compensated by its thicker atmosphere.

            <p>
                Ghaláera is the largest of the two stars, but since it is around 100 times further from our planet than
                Narháera, it looks much smaller in the sky. Its color frequencies peak from lilac to ultraviolet.
                Because of this long distance, Ghaláera's effects on our planet's climate are much more subtle, but
                still very noticeable, such as creating two more seasons in certain latitudes of the globe in which
                leaves grow in a different color. Its rays of radiation seem to have influenced evolution of life on our
                planet in many ways, sometimes by provoquing exctintion, others by accelerating genetic variability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of our planet orbiting only Narháera, the angle of Ghaláera in the sky changes completely during
                the year. The dawn and dusk of both stars in the sky get in and out of sync as our planet proceeds its
                translation, even at the equator where the planet's acute axial tilt is not a factor. In higher
                latitudes, these stars can dance on the firmament quite wildly.
