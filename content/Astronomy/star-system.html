        <h1>Star System</h1>
        <p>The planet of Erdain is located in a Type-S Binary Star System, in which two stars, Narháera and Ghaláera,
            orbit around each other at a distance of around 80 to 100 Astronomical Units (in earthly measurements).
        <p>These stars weren't arranged together since they were born though. Our planet orbits around Narháera, which
            may be only half as massive as its partner, but is eight times as old. As it drifted through the galaxy, its
            orbit met young Ghaláera's by around 1 billion Erdain-Years (or 800 million Earth-Years) before the
            development of Hominid Societies, creating a binary system which seems to be gradually pulling the stars
            closer together.</p>
