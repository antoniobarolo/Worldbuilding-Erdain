            <h1>The Planet</h1>
            <p>
                Erdain is a rocky planet with similar habitable conditions to Earth, though with a much more intense
                climate.
                The main differences are that in finds itself in a Type-S Binary Star System and that it has an axial
                tilt of 58 degrees.
                Also, the length of a day and an year are shorter than Earth's, its atmosphere is thicke, having
                especially a higher proportion of water, oxygen, and CO2 than Earth's. Erdain is also smaller, with a
                radius
                similar to Venus, and the gravity is weaker there.
                <br><br>
                Due to its high axial tilt, the planet suffers with several days of continuous sunlight or night-time
                even at low latitudes, making the warmer portions of Erdain's surface be at the poles, while the equator
                is the coldest. This causes the polar and tropical climates to switch positions in comparison to Earth,
                although these climates and their respective biomes function very differently in Erdain.
                <br><br>
                By result of these factors Erdain also has a warmer overall temperature than current day Earth, and is
                distinct for its way stronger air and ocean currents. Due to this, the planet is also known as the
                <strong>Stormy Sphere</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Formation and Composition</h2>
            <p>
                Erdain formed in an equivalent fashion to Earth, from the collision of planetoids around <a
                    href="star-system.html">Narháera</a>.
                A little later the Stormy Sphere also suffered larger collisions that formed its <a
                    href="moon.html">Moons</a>.
                <br><br>
                Being considerably younger than Earth, Erdain has a higher inner temperature, though its smaller size
                atenuates this difference a bit. And by a small margin, Erdain has proportinally more iron than Earth,
                and a thicker inner core. These factors provide a stronger magnetic field that protects it from the
                close rays of <strong>Narháera</strong> and the highly radioactive rays of <strong>Ghaláera</strong>.
                <br><br>
                Other factors that contributes to this magnetic field are its lower gravity and size, making Erdain's
                crust thicker and its tectonic activity stronger. On that note, the planet also has greater amplitude of
                relief.

            <h2>Rotations</h2>
            Despite being very distant, <a href="star-system.html">Ghaláera</a> is twice as big
            as the star that Erdain orbits, and it is very radioactive. <br>
